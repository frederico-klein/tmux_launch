# tmux_launch

This is a replacement for roslaunch that instead divides the launch files into windows and panes depending on how many nodes you have. 

It's useful for debugging things and now I don't need to setup my custom yaml files that generate launch files and stuff, which was quite complicated, so this is nicer. 

I haven't tested it almost at all: it worked once and i decided to commit it. 

It also opens like a lot of unnecessary panes currently. I gotta improve that.
